# Grade-Point-Average-Calculator
This is a 5.0 G.P.A calculator  
This Web Application  Is Specifically Developed To Calculate Grade Point Average Automatically For Undergraduate Student.
It was developed purely with javascript with little html and css. Check The UI(User Interface)By Using This Link https://olawalejuwonm.github.io/Grade-Point-Average-Calculator/
To Verify How It Works.
Note: It Only Calculates G.P.A Based  On 5.0 Scale.
I will try and make it flexible for calculating from 4.0 to 7.0 G.P.A.
